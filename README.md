## My Sites

[FED Mentor](https://fedmentor.dev) is where I blog about all things accessibility and front end development. The goal is to give newer devs the important foundations most courses miss out.

[Grace Snow Design](https://gracesnowdesign.co.uk) is a portfolio site I built quite a few years ago. It's CSS needs streamlining, but the content is pretty up to date!

The other site I recommend you check out is [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/grace-snow). That's where you can see a few instructional projects I've built and the _many_ comments and bits of feedback I've given to junior developers. 

## About me

- I enjoy Vue.js more than any other JavaScript framework
- I care about equality and inclusion more than all else
