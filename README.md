ðŸŒˆ **Accessibility Specialist | Frontend Developer & Mentor | Strategist | Inclusivity Chapion**

- [FED Mentor](https://fedmentor.dev) is my frontend and accessibility-focused blog site
- [Grace Snow Design](https://gracesnowdesign.co.uk) is my (now rather out-dated!) personal site
- Check out [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/grace-snow) to see _loads_ of (hopefully) helpful feedback I've given to junior developers

## A few facts about me...

- I am a [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional)
- I'm pursuing further certifications with the [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org) 
- I moved away from front end development to focus more on accessibility in recent years.
- I'm currently an accessibility specialist at a great company.
- I love working with Static Site Generators and vanilla front end tech stacks, especially focusing on content-first designs that still look great and are accessible. 
- I enjoy Vue.js more than any other JavaScript framework.
- I care about **equality and inclusion** more than all else.
